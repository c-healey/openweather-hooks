#  Open Weather app

## Description

Build a simple weather forecast application based on the OpenWeatherMap API


### Story

-  Create a “Current Temperature” page that fetches and displays the current temperature
at the user’s current location. [OpenWeather Current local weather](https://www.openweathermap.org/current)

-  Add a “5 Day Temperatures” page to your application that fetches and displays the 5 day
forecast for the user’s current location. Display all of the 3-hourly forecasts within this 5
day period. [Open Weather 5 day forecast](https://www.openweathermap.org/forecast5)

The user should be able to access this "5 Day Forecast" page from the "Current
Temperature" page. You may choose the navigation pattern used. For example, both
pages could be top-level tabs within your application.
Each row in the list should display:
● The forecast date and time
● The forecast temperature in Fahrenheit
● The OpenWeatherMap icon that represents the forecast weather conditions.

### Implementation

- Framework: Reactjs
- Libraries: Semantic-ui, OpenWeather
- Test: Jest, Enzyme

React - A React Hooks implementation using HashRouter, Route and Link.

Semantic-Ui. Basic UI styling with a nice responsive grid.


### Usage
-  git clone https://github.com/c-healey/openweather-hooks.git
-  npm i
-  npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
